sql insert one by one, 180+ need 6s, each need 0.4s, should use trancation commit to slove.
get psinfo from mem, if open task when it run, may occur core dump, need pause and resume
if a ps in ACL, now only find same name. id not care!!!
if every vm use one process may not need array to store vmiinfo! Not need to find vmiinfo use vmi!!
